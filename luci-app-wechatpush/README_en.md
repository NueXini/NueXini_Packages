**OpenWrt Notification Plugin – Send Alerts to WeChat or Telegram**

This OpenWrt plugin delivers real-time router notifications to your mobile device via **WeChat** or **Telegram**. Monitor your network with alerts for:

- [x] IP changes (IPv4/IPv6)
- [x] Device connections (online/offline)
- [x] Online client list & traffic usage
- [x] CPU load & temperature (including virtualized hosts like PVE)
- [x] Router status reports
- [x] Security alerts (failed web/SSH logins with auto blacklist)
- [x] Port knocking & automated tasks

Supported services:
| Push application | Method | description |

## Instructions

**Regarding Installation:**

The plugin requires dependencies on iputils-arping + curl + jq + bash. For routers with limited memory, please consider the installation carefully. **Before installing, please run the opkg update command to install dependencies during the installation process.**

Developed based on X86 OpenWrt v23.05.0, different systems and devices may encounter various issues. **If you encounter errors in temperature information retrieval, display errors, or other issues, please adapt accordingly.**

**Regarding Hostnames:**

For devices that do not declare hostnames, devices connected via optical modem dial-up, OpenWrt used as a bypass gateway, and other scenarios where hostname retrieval fails, you can set the hostname using the following methods:

- Use device name remarks.
- Configure to obtain the hostname from the optical modem in advanced settings.
- Enable MAC device database.
- Install samba*-server or samba*-client to enable the program to query hostnames via NetBIOS.


**Regarding Device Online Status:**

By default, ping/arping is used to actively detect device online status to counter Wi-Fi sleep mechanism. Active detection takes more time but provides more accurate device online status.

- If devices frequently go into sleep mode, please adjust the timeout settings in advanced settings.
- If you don't require highly precise device online information and only need other features, you can disable active detection in advanced settings.


**Regarding Traffic Statistics:**

Traffic statistics functionality depends on `wrtbwmon`. Please install or compile it yourself. **Enabling this plugin will conflict with Routing/NAT, Flow Offloading, proxy internet access, and other plugins, resulting in the inability to obtain traffic statistics. Please choose accordingly.**

**About Hard Drive Information:**

When the OpenWrt system or remote host (PVE) does not have lsblk installed, the hard drive capacity information may be inconsistent with the actual capacity.

When the OpenWrt system or remote host (PVE) does not have smartctl installed, information such as hard drive temperature, uptime, and health status will not be available.

**Regarding Bug Submissions:**

When submitting a bug, please provide the following information if possible:

- Device information and plugin version number.
- Prompt information after executing `/usr/share/wechatpush/wechatpush`.
- Log information and file information in the `/tmp/wechatpush/` directory after encountering an error.
- Detailed execution information of `bash -x /usr/share/wechatpush/wechatpush t1`.
